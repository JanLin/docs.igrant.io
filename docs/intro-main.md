iGrant.io platform provides the infrastructure for human-centric personal data management and governance. It enables consented data exchange between organisations while complying to persoanl data regulations such as GDPR. In this model, the individual manages data flows directly from the data sources to the data using services. 

This documentation lays out how any organisation can leverage the microservices developed within iGrant.io to reduce the risk of non-compliance to data protection regulations and take on the role as a Data Operator whereby individuals are empowered to share their personal data within an auditable data governance framework. It also explains the key functional elements of iGrant.io as a MyData Operator. 

iGrant.io is a certified MyData Operator and is committed to adhere to MyData principles of ensuring human-centricity in digitalisation. Being the co-founders of MyData Operator initiative, we continue to drive a fully interoperable, decentralised network of data operators that enables consented data sharing and exchange within a personal data ecosystem. 

As a certified MyData Operator, iGrant.io services are mapped to the MyData Operator reference model as laid out in the [MyData Global Operator whitepaper](https://igrant.io/papers/Understanding-Mydata-Operators.pdf).
