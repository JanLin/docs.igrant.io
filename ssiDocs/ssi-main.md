iGrant.io Self-Sovereign Identity Services describes the SSI enablers and tooling distributed by iGrant.io. The purpose is to make it easy for organisations new to SSI to adopt and implement Self-Sovereign Identity based on [Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (DIDs) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VCs), a new digital identity standard. 

iGrant.io SSI services are based on open-source Hyperledger Aries project. We are primarily contribting to this via [NGI-Trust eSSIF-Lab](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/) initiative and our open source code is hosted at [Decentrialised Data Exchange GitHub](https://github.com/decentralised-dataexchange) and is based on Apache 2.0 open source licensing. All efforts have been made to ensure that the schemas etc follow open standards.

The [Aries playground](https://docs.igrant.io/ssi/ssi-apg) environment, make it easy for developers to issue Verifiable Credentials on behalf of an organisation (**Data Source**). These credentials can be used by individuals to prove their data to any **Data Using Service**.
